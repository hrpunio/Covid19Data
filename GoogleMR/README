Google Community Mobility Reports
www.google.com/covid19/mobility/

[Google has launched a new website that uses
anonymous location data collected from users of Google products and
services to show the level of social distancing taking place in
various locations.  The COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports web site
will show population data trends of six categories: Retail and
recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces,
and residential. The data will track changes over the course of
several weeks, and as recent as 48-to-72 hours prior, and will
initially cover 131 countries as well as individual counties within
certain states.]

The raports contains charts and comments in the form:
NN% compared to baseline (in six above mentioned categories) where NN is a number.
It is assumed the number is a %% change at the last date 
depicted (which accidentaly is a part of a filename). So for example a filename
2020-03-29_PL_Mobility_Report_en.txt
contains a sentence `Retail & recreation -78% compared to baseline` which (probably)
means that somwhow registered traffic at R&R facilities was 22% of the baseline.
Anyway those six numbers was extracted for OECD countries (and some other countries) 
and converted to CSV file.
